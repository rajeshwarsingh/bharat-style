              The Hands That Weave Magic
            </h2>
            <p>
              In a small, sun-drenched village in West Bengal, the rhythmic clatter of handlooms is the music of daily life. This is where <strong>TheTidbit</strong> was born—not in a corporate boardroom, but on the mud porch of Lakshmi Devi's home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jute, known as the "Golden Fiber," has been the lifeline of this region for centuries. However, with the rise of fast fashion and plastic, the traditional art of jute weaving began to fade. Artisans like Lakshmi found themselves with incredible skills but no market.

              The journey of your bag begins in the jute fields. The plants are harvested, retted in water, and stripped of their golden fibers. These fibers are then spun into strong, durable yarn.

              The intricate embroidery you see on the round sling bag is done entirely by hand. No machines, no automation. Just a needle, colorful cotton threads, and a steady hand. This ensures that <strong>no two bags are exactly alike</strong>. Your bag is as unique as your fingerprint.
