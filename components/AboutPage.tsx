              How It Began
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              We're a small team of people who love beautiful things. Simple, honest things. Things made by human hands, not machines. We noticed something—there was a gap. On one side, incredible artisans in rural India with skills passed down through generations, struggling to find markets for their craft. On the other side, women in cities looking for sustainable, meaningful fashion but finding mostly mass-produced options.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              So we decided to do something about it. Not because it was a "market opportunity" or a "business model." Because it felt right. Because we believed that beautiful, handmade things should have a place in modern life. Because we wanted to connect these two worlds.

              The Hands Behind Every Bag
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              Our bags are made in small workshops and homes across West Bengal. These aren't factories. They're spaces where craft lives. Where mothers teach daughters. Where neighbors work together. Where creating something beautiful is still an act of love, not just a job.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We work directly with these artisans. No middlemen. No complicated supply chains. Just direct relationships. This means they earn fair wages. It means they have dignity in their work. It means when you buy a bag, you're not just supporting a brand—you're supporting a family, a community, a craft.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Many of these artisans are women. Women who've been weaving and embroidering since they were young. Women who've kept these traditions alive through decades of change. Women who are now able to earn a living doing what they love, from their homes, on their own terms.

            <p>
              Every bag starts with jute—India's golden fiber. It's grown by local farmers, processed by hand, and then transformed into fabric. The embroidery? That's done stitch by stitch, thread by thread. No machines. No automation. Just skill, patience, and care.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This means every bag is unique. The slight variations in the embroidery, the texture of the jute, the way the colors settle—these aren't flaws. They're proof that this was made by a person, not a machine. They're what make your bag yours and yours alone.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              It also means it takes time. Real time. Hours of work go into every bag. But we think that's beautiful. In a world of instant everything, there's something deeply satisfying about something that took time to make, that was made with care, that was made to last.
